# jetson_car

Self-driving car project. It's still in progress, being built to autonomously drive around a track as quickly as possible. It uses edge detection to find the sides of the path and then passes that edge tensor into a model that calculates a steering command to keep the robot on the path.

(I still need to come up with a proper name for it ðŸ˜‚)
